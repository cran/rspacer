public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rspacer is to wrap the [RSpace
API](https://community.researchspace.com/public/apiDocs), that is, allow
you to use the API directly from R using convenience functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rspacer with

``` r
remotes::install_github("lacdr/rspacer")
```

## Usage

See the [Get
started](https://lacdr.github.io/rspacer/articles/rspacer.html) article
how to use this package.

**NB:** API Paging/rate limiting is not properly handled yet, but this
can be worked around.
